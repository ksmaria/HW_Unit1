## Overview and Origin

* Name of company <br>
    Blockstream
* When was the company incorporated?<br>
    2014
* Who are the founders of the company?<br>
	The founders of the company include;
	- Adam Back (CEO Blockstream)
	- Jonathan Wilkins (CSO Blockstream)
	- Francesca Hall (Chief Events Manager at Blockstream)
	- Greg Maxwell (ex-CTO at Blockstream)
	- Peter Wuille (ex-Core Tech Engineer at Blockstream)
	- Matt Corallo (previously Bitcoin core developer at Blockstream)
	- Mark Friedenbach (ex-Research engineer at Blockstream)
	- Jorge Timon (ex-Head engineer at Blockstream)
	- Austin Hill and Alex Fowler (ex-SVP Business Affairs at Blockstream). 
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? <br>
    In 2014, a whitepaper titled “Enabling Blockchain Innovations with Pegged Sidechains” released by Adam Back highlight's that the objective of Bitcoin was simple, it’s a blockchain supporting the transfer of a single digital asset which is not redeemable for anything else. However, real world demands were evolving very fast and the ideas and solutions to key gaps (identified below) formed the basis for this company.
	1.	Blockchain confirmations were too slow which made transactions slow (sometimes more than 10 minutes).
	2.	Sophisticated blockchains could be used for other financial domains rather than just for transfer of Bitcoins e.g. IOUs, contracts and smart property. 
	3. 2014 marked 5 years since the inception of Bitcoin and the technology was growing fast. New technology could enable new features, uses and functionality of Bitcoin which weren’t imagined when Bitcoin came into existence back in 2009. 
	In response to these gaps, Blockstream announced the release of a sidechain named Liquid. A sidechain is an independent blockchain that can enable transfer of bitcoins both internally and to/from the Bitcoin network . Liquid decreased the settlement times on transactions. It was intended for larger transactions between trusted entities. It’s usability was similar to Ripple vs. Lightning which was intended solely for frequent and smaller transactions. This modern sidechain also enabled scalability to new financial assets to the blockchain. 
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?<br>
	As per Crunchbase, Blockstream has received $299 million in fundings since Nov 17, 2014 . It’s fundings include venture capital financing (two rounds - series A and series B) and seed fundings (security offerings in exchange for equity stake in the company). The 9 lead investors include Baillie Gifford, Bitfinex, DG Lab, AXA Venture Partners, Digital Garage, Horizons Ventures, Khosla Ventures, Real Ventures and Reid Hoffman.

## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?<br>
	The biggest problem with Bitcoin - it is illiquid. Transactions on the main blockchain are slow and thus expensive. Blockstream tries to resolve this problem by reducing latency through the sidechain network. Blockstream’ s Liquid sidechain helps make Bitcoin more liquid! It enables faster, confidential Bitcoin transactions and allows the move of Bitcoin between the BTC mainchain and Liquid sidechain. Another Blockstream product, Blockstream Green, helps provide the users with a secure and easy-to-use wallet to store Bitcoins. 
* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?<br>
	Blockstream’s key service, Liquid sidechain, is intended for exchanges and traders. There are at least 21 exchanges and 16 traders who are a member of the Liquid Network . 
* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)<br>
	Apart from having a first mover advantage vs. all its other 43 rivals in Canada and the ≈ $300m of fundings it has received to date, Blockstream has four satellites across multiple coverage zones . These satellites allow the users to send data over its own network. Even in the absence of internet, users can connect to the Bitcoin network using SMS gateways. 
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)<br>
	Blockstream is using applications such as PHP and NGINX, utilities such as Google Analytics and business tools such as WordPress and G Suite . Also, they stay updated with any BTC technology upgrades such as Taproot . 

## Landscape

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?<br>
	Blockchain and Cryptocurrency
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?<br>
	The goal of Blockchain is to introduce technology systems of trust and exchange which allows users to send digital assets to each other without a need for expensive intermediaries. It is definitely the most disruptive innovation in the financial markets in recent times (cryptocurrency market cap is almost $2T vs. a global $5T banking industry ). Apart from cryptocurrencies, Blockchain is disrupting and creating many other industries  including (but not limited to):
	1.	NFTs: NFTs are non-fungible tokens or simply digital assets (e.g. music, pictures, videos etc) that live on the blockchain and have gained value due to their uniqueness. These ‘digital collectables’ are a brand new asset class that cannot be duplicated or copied. The interest in this asset class is unprecedented with artworks being sold for millions of dollars. 
	2.	Enterprise Blockchain: Enterprise blockchains are the democratization of blockchain technology. Companies are able to create their own centralized blockchains. For example, banks using it for ledgering and accounting. 
	3.	Blockchain-as-a-Service: Many companies like AWS, Google and Microsoft are offering developing tools and platforms allowing companies to economically utilize the Blockchain technology. They offer it along with their many on-demand cloud offerings like AI, IOT etc.
	4.	Blockchain the Pharma/Medicine: We are seeing increased usage of blockchain technology in the medical sector to create permanent and non-falsifiable records. There are hospitals trialing blockchain to track distribution of chemotherapy drugs and to track Covid19 vaccine distribution. 
* What are the other major companies in this domain?<br>
	The biggest competition Blockstream has is Hut 8, RIOT, BlockCypher, Coinify, bitpay, coinbase, HIVE, Gocoin, FACTOM, Ripple and Gemini, Circle and Steem. 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?<br>
	Blockstream is one of pioneers in democratization of blockchain. The sidechain network has made the financial markets more scalable, efficient and latent by reducing the reliance of trust (thus reducing time). 
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?<br>
	There are several Blockchain metrics that are used to measure scalability, quality and performance of blockchain apps. These metrics determine the success of a particular Blockchain project. Some of these measures include:
	1.	Active nodes: Active nodes or ‘active addresses’ simply means how many unique addresses are connected to the blockchain at a certain time (hour, day, week etc). High number of connected nodes indicates that blockchain application is both accessible and popular. 
	2.	Transactions per second: A high number of transactions per second means also indicates a success of the blockchain app. 
	3.	Transaction’s latency: The time it takes between when a transaction is submitted to the time it is recorded in the ledger is called ‘transactions latency’. The lower the latency, higher the success of the blockchain app. 
	Blockstream’s Liquid blockchain is much faster than Bitcoin Blockchain. An average transaction takes around 2 minutes. Keeping in mind this blockchain is intended for traders 2 minutes is a very short amount of time. 2 minutes would have been very slow for a retail transaction. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?<br>
	This British Columbia based FinTech company has received $300m of fundings in recent years and valuated at more than $3.2B. It has a lot of competition but has made good use of its first mover advantage. Unlike most of its competition which has stuck to mining, Blockstream has released four of its own satellites and is about to manufacture its own mining chips to stop relying on the oligopoly of chip manufacturers. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)<br>
	Every year thousands of welfare organizations, NGOs and NFPs collect billions of dollars to help cure global hunger. Yet close to 700 million people go to bed hungry every night. I would advise a mechanism to trace each value donated and what percentage of it is used to buy food vs. what percentage is used to fund the fund-raising entity. This will help monitor, document and trace the flow of funds and create transparency for donors and perhaps reduce global hunger
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?<br>
	Blockstream does suffer from a brand image issue. There is quite a bit of twitter accusing Blockstream of charging hefty monthly fees for its sidechain users. Being involved in a good cause may bring intangible benefits in the form of a reputational enhancement. 
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?<br>
	Blockchain will act as a ledger tracing the flow of money. 
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?<br>
	Blockchain removes the use of any intermediaries thus reducing the risk of data manipulation. A blockchain ledger would be a more sophisticated manner of tracing donations vs. a traditional method where human intervention and greed can cause irregularities or corruption.
